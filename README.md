# web-config

A utility library containing configuration and setup code for webapps.

## Eslint

All eslint configuration and dependencies for both JavaScript and TypeScript are included here.

If a custom eslint configuration is needed, it will be searched for in the parent project here: `<rootDir>/eslint.config.js`.

By default, this internal eslint config is used: `eslint/index.js`.

To run eslint, use this NPM script: `web-config-scripts lint`.
